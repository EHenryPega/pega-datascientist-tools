# Value Finder

The Value Finder simulations create a dataset called "pyValueFinder". This dataset contains the decision records including
the stage labels that is used for the analysis that results in the typical Value Finder pie chart.

In the data folder we've stored a copy of such a dataset, generated from an (internal) demo application (CDHSample).

This notebook shows an example how the data can be read for additional analysis.

# Pega results

For the sample provided, the under-served threshold is 1.2%. There are 10.000 customers, 
3491 without actions, 555 under-served and 5954 well-served.

# Data read

PropensityThreshold is in the data but represents the CDH threshold. It is not the VF threshold.

```{r}
simdata <- readDSExport("Data-Insights_pyValueFinder", "../../data")
simdata[, pyStage := factor(pyStage, levels = c("Eligibility", "Applicability", "Suitability", "Arbitration"))]
```

The propensity threshold defaults to the 5th percentile of the model propensities
in the first stage.

The total number of customers is not available in this dataset. We're guessing it 
in the code below but you can also just hard-code it to a fixed number.

```{r}
th <- quantile(simdata[pyStage=="Eligibility"]$pyModelPropensity, probs = 0.05) # seems close
th <- 0.0122 # TODO automatic, 5th percentile
ncust <- 10^ceiling(log10(uniqueN(simdata$pySubjectID))) # this number is not in the data, we're guessing it is a power of 10
```

# Propensity Distribution

CDH produces a few different propensities. ModelPropensity is the original propensity
from the model and that is what is being used by Value Finder. For completeness we're
showing the others too. FinalPropensity has Thompson Sampling applied so has some 
noise - more noise when the number of responses sent to the model is lower.

Showing the distribution across stages

```{r}
ggplot(simdata, aes(x=pyModelPropensity)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(colour=pyStage)) +
  geom_density(aes(x = pyModelPropensity), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_discrete_divergingx() +
  facet_grid(pyStage ~ .) +
  ggtitle("Propensity Distribution", subtitle = "per NBAD Stage")
```

For just the first stage, but showing the various propensity properties

```{r warning=FALSE}
simdataPropensities <- melt(simdata[pyStage=="Eligibility", c("pyModelPropensity", "pyPropensity", "FinalPropensity")])

simdataPropensities[, variable:=factor(variable, levels = rev(unique(variable)))]

ggplot(simdataPropensities, aes(value, fill=variable, colour=variable)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), position = position_dodge(), bins=40) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +
  scale_fill_discrete_diverging(name="Type") + 
  scale_colour_discrete_diverging(guide=F) + xlab("Propensity") +
  facet_grid(variable ~ .) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=th, linetype="dashed") +
  ggtitle("Propensity distribution", "first stage")
```

The data is summarized per customer and per stage. In a standard value finder
run only one action remains per customer / per stage as we prioritize by max
propensity.

Customers are considered "well served" if they have at least 1 action for which
the propensity is above the threshold.

```{r}
customersummary <- simdata[, .(MaxPropensity = max(pyPropensity),
                               MaxFinalPropensity = max(FinalPropensity), # This includes Thompson sampling
                               MaxModelPropensity = max(pyModelPropensity), 
                               InRandomControlGroup = ModelControlGroup[which.max(pyModelPropensity)] == "Control",
                               NOffers = .N), by=c("CustomerID","pyStage")][order(CustomerID,pyStage)]
customersummary[, isWellServed := (MaxModelPropensity >= th)]

customersummary %>% head(200)
```

## Counts per Stage

To replicate the numbers from the Pega UI, we show the stages as a funnel, and
the number of customers remaining in each stage. The customers are labeled as
being "well served" (at least 1 action with a higher propensity), "under served"
(receiving one or more actions but all lower propensity) or "no action", meaning
they don't get anything at all - typically because of rule based filtering.

```{r warning=FALSE}
countsPerStage <- customersummary[, .(WellServed = sum(isWellServed), NotWellServed = sum(!isWellServed), NoAction = ncust - .N), by=pyStage]
countsPerStage[, yWellServed := WellServed/2]
countsPerStage[, yNotWellServed := WellServed + NotWellServed/2]
countsPerStage[, yNoAction := WellServed + NotWellServed + NoAction/2]

# Values picked using ColorSync tool on Value Finder pie chart
colorcodes <- list(rgb(205,0,32,maxColorValue=255),
                   rgb(252,165,46,maxColorValue=255),
                   "darkblue",
                   rgb(33,158,63,maxColorValue=255))

countsPerStage <- melt(countsPerStage, id=c("pyStage", "yWellServed", "yNotWellServed", "yNoAction"), value.name = "Count", variable.name = "Status")

countsPerStage[, Status := factor(Status, levels=c("NoAction", "NotWellServed", "WellServed"))]
countsPerStage[, yText := ifelse(Status=="WellServed", yWellServed, ifelse(Status=="NotWellServed", yNotWellServed, yNoAction))]
countsPerStage[, Delta := Count - shift(Count, fill = 0), by=Status]

ggplot(countsPerStage,
       aes(pyStage, y=Count, fill=Status)) +
  geom_col(colour="black", alpha=0.8) +
  geom_text(data = countsPerStage[Status == "NoAction" & pyStage != "Eligibility"], mapping = aes(label=paste0(Count, " (-", Delta, ")"), y=yText)) +
  geom_text(data = countsPerStage[Status != "NoAction" | pyStage == "Eligibility"], mapping = aes(label=Count, y=yText)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(colorcodes[1], colorcodes[2], colorcodes[4]))
```

# Additional analysis: Looking at the number of offers 

This will be relevant when we use a Value Finder - like analysis that spits
out not just the top-1 but more than that. The standard Value Finder only 
emits strategy results for the max propensity offer.
