    "## Exporting ADM Datamart \n",
    "\n",
    "You need ADM Datamart Snapshots downloaded on you computer before you can run a Health Chech on them. Please check out this [article](https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-datascientist-tools/wiki/How-to-export-and-use-the-ADM-Datamart) to learn how export your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downloading the Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you need Python with version 3.8 or greater and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed in your system. You can check which python version you have by running this snippet in your command line\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "![python version check](../../../../images/python_version.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, I have Python with version 3.10. You can also check your pip version with this command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can proceed to download pdstools and other libraries required to run Health Check app. You can enter the snippet below to your command line to download all the required libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pdstools['app']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've got pdstools and other necessary packages installed, you can double-check pdstools version to make sure everything went smoothly!\n",
    "\n",
    "![pdstools version](../../../../images/pdstools_version.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "My pdstools version is 3.1.7. If your pdstools version is below 3.1, you should upgrade it with this command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pdstools\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the App\n",
    "\n",
    "With the required packages successfully installed, you may now initiate your application using this command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pdstools run\n",
    "```\n",
    "![run](../../../../images/run.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon executing this command, the app should open up in your system browser. If the app does not open up automatically, simply copy the Local URL from your terminal and paste it into your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using the App: A Step-by-Step Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "- The browser opens up with the Home page, from the left hand side, simply click on Hand Check to get started with the HealthCheck app.\n",
    "\n",
    "![introduction](../../../../images/introduction.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Please read the introduction page to learn more about the correct usage of the app, then you can move to Data Import tab to upload your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![data_import](../../../../images/data_import.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data import\n",
    "- You can upload your ADMDatamart data in this tab. \n",
    "If you're using Treatments, make sure to add it to the context keys in the *Configure Advanced Options* section by clicking on *Extract Additional Keys*.\n",
    "Additionally, if you are not using all the default context keys(Channel, Direction, Issue, and Group), feel free to remove the ones you won't be using.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, you can select your import method from the dropdown menu under Data Import. You will see 4 options:\n",
    "    - **Direct file path:** Simply paste the root folder path where the ADM files are located. *Ex. /User/Downloads/*\n",
    "    - **Direct file upload:** Browse your local files with this option. If you don't have access Predictor Binning files, you can upload only the Model Snapshot file and then click on the checkbox to confirm that you want to run only model-based Health Check\n",
    "    - **CDH Sample:** You can generate a sample HealthCheck with this option. It is a convenient way to test out the Health Check using a CDH Sample dataset.\n",
    "    - **Download from S3:** This feature is not implemented yet but soon, you will be able to run HealthCheck without downloading the files to your local system if they are located in S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data filters\n",
    "After the data is imported into the app you can easily add custom filters to specify the Health Check to your needs.\n",
    "For just analyzing models in the Web channel, select \"Channel\" from dropdown, delete other channels (if any), move to next tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "![data_filters](../../../../images/data_filters.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Report configuration\n",
    "In this tab you can configure some options for the outputs and then generate your Health Check document. The options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer name:** Change the name of the Health Check file that will generated\n",
    "- **Select output type:** Change output format under this field\n",
    "- **Change working directory:** You can change folder name where the generated files will be stored\n",
    "\n",
    "Check Boxes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remove temporary files:** Chose whether you want to keep temporary files or not. *Note:* If you get an error while the Health Check is being generated, you can deselect this checkbox and share the log which should be created under the directory you named in *Change working directory* section\n",
    "- **Include tables in document:** Whether to include the overview tables embedded in the document itself or to separately recieve these in a tabbed Excel file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can click on the **Generate Health Check** button. You will see the **Download Health Check** button once your document is generated. You can download Health Check by clicking on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can create a Bug report if you get an error in any step of the process to ask for assistance from this [link](https://github.com/pegasystems/pega-datascientist-tools/issues) by openning up an issue"
