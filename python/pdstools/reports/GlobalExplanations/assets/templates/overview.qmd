## Predictor contributions at model level
The top-10 predictors over the entire model, selected by their absolute average contribution to predictions

```{{python}}
from pdstools.explanations import ExplanationsDataLoader as DataLoader, ExplanationsDataPlotter as DataPlotter

data_loader = DataLoader("{DATA_FOLDER}")
plots = DataPlotter.plot_overall_contributions(data_loader, top_n={TOP_N}, top_k={TOP_K})
plots[0].show()
```

## Predictor value contributions at model level
The predictor value contributions for the top-10 predictors. Similar to above, the predictor values are selected by their absolute average contribution to predictions.

```{{python}}
#| output: asis
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
for plot in plots[1:]:
    title = plot.layout['title']['text']
    plot.layout['title']['text'] = ''
    display(Markdown(f'### {{title}}'), plot)
